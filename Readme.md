# HTML / CSS Information Architecture 
###### v0.0.1

A simple IA that is fueled by vanilla nested HTML lists.

***

A great Information Architecture is one of the first steps to building a website. Create your own interactive HTML IA for use in the browser simply by pasting a nested ordered list into a file! 

This was inspired by the modern way wireframes are being created for the browser by tools like Axure.

### Demo

Here's [an example](http://rle.me/ia/) using the Adobe site structure as a guide. 

### Make your own

Download the files, and change the nested ordered list in sitemap.php. There's a bunch of hard codey stuff in the index you can change too. 

### Futurey stuff
There's so much more that could be included here, but I'm going to keep this basic for now as it is just a stepping stone towards building a website. 

Possible future updates may include

- Cookies to remember toggle states
- Print and mobile friendlier
- Make it pertier
- Some kind of list / details generator

#### Thanks!
